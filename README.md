# Django SNS Redis

## Welcome!

Welcome to Django SNS Redis! This package lets you send push notifications right from your [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com) project using [Amazon's](https://aws.amazon.com) [Simple Notification Service](https://aws.amazon.com/sns/). The cool thing about it is that is has a built-in Redis cache for storing devices' ARNs (specially usefull when you have tons of users and don't wanna squeeze your relational database).
